## How it works

This is an example state machine for an elevator.  The state machine simulates an elevator moving between floors indicated by pressing a button.  There is a 1 second delay as the elevator moves from the floor to floor.  The display shows the current floor.  The period indicates the elevator is stopped and the door is open.

## How to test

Select one of the inputs corresponding to a floor button. 

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
